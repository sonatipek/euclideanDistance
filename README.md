Euclidean distance is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. This formula can be used to find the distance between two points in a plane or in three-dimensional space.

## Task
Using functions and loops in Python, you need to create a program that performs the following tasks:

### Defining the Points:
Create a list called 'points'. This list should contain tuples representing points in 2D space. For example, the point '(x, y)' should be represented as a tuple '(x, y)'.

### Writing a Function for Euclidean Distance:
Define a function called 'euclideanDistance'. This function should take two tuples (each representing a point) and return the Euclidean distance between these two points.

### Calculating Distances:
Use a loop to calculate the Euclidean distance between every pair of points in the 'points' list. Store these distances in another list called 'distances'.

### Finding the Minimum Distance:
Find and print the minimum distance from the 'distances' list.
